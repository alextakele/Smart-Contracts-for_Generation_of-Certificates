# Objective
The client has joined forces with Algorand to leverage the Algorand Blockchain as the core infrastructure for the NFT. Now, I will be developing comprehensive Web3 decentralized applications on the Algorand Blockchain. These applications aim to facilitate the creation and distribution of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) functioning as certificates. These certificates signify the successful completion of weekly challenges by trainees. Additionally, trainees possessing these NFTs will have the capability to engage with a smart contract, enabling them to execute predefined actions.
